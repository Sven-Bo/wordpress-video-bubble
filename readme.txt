A lightweight video bubble widget with muted autoplay, contact form, and webhook integration.

== Description ==

Video Bubble adds a small circular video to the corner of your site that plays on mute. When visitors click it, it expands into a panel with the full video and a contact form. Submissions are sent to any webhook URL you configure.

Think Warm Welcome, but simpler and self-hosted.
